Program logistic_regresion_model.py predicts if student get to college based on informations about the earlier result of student two exams from highschool.

Program logistic_regresion_with_regularyzation predict if processor pass the quality test based on two parametrs.

The data are discrete, hipotesis wich is use is sigmoid function.

Programs use gradiendt descent method by minimize function to find best theta parametrs.

In second program there is added the regularyzation parametr to predict the overfitting.
